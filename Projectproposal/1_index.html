                My project will be a travel recommendation/blog that incorporates an interactive map where users can click.
                <br>
               I will be using React as the Javascript library in order to execute this website and make it an interactive expereince for the user.

            <h2>
                 The landing page will be a hand drawn map with various points that the user can click on to be redirected to various pages.

                 For someone who really enjoys travelling and is unable to do so because of COVID-19, I thought this would be a fun virtual way for people to experience the world.
