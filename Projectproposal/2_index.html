                The website will have a fun creative look to it, while incoporating a professional style. There will be images along with original drawings and doodles.

                I intend to use both Bootstrap and React to create this virtual travel experience as I can make use of the UI functions that they both offer. 
                <br>
             Bootstrap is easily customizable and will allow a smoother method for me to create a website with responsive styles and structures. I am, however, unfamiliar with Bootstrap so I will need to do research and watch tutorials to understand it better. 
             This also gives me the ability to turn the website into an app for future use perhaps.
