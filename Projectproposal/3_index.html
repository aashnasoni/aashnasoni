               The interactive travel experience allows for users to also log in their own travel experiences in the past or the future. They can also make a list of places they would like to visit after the pandemic is over and what they would like to do there. Further, there will be mini hand-drawn animated doodles that will move around with the website and create a more interactive experience when a user clicks a button.
