                "Rafael Rozendaal is a Dutch internet artist who creates work using a computer screen as his canvas. 
                <br>
                He also creates installations and sculptures that involve human interaction that is inspired by design and programming."

            <h2>
                 “I make websites-as-artworks. They are concise moving images, generative, random, colorful, moody… I hope. I started making websites in 1999. The internet was a great place then, the early days before the web became corporate. It was an optimistic time full of promise. It was very exciting.”
                <br>
                 His work has always suited the comforts for people at home as they are launched through a website. He refers to the works as “dead ends” as they have no links, no information and there is only a sense of movement. Once the user is introduced to the artwork, all they can do is stare at it.
