                “The idea is that the website is like liquid, or like gas...it adapts to whatever environment it has.” - Rafael Rozendaal

            <h2>
                The artwork was created in 2010 using Flash, then migrated to Javascript. Interactive experience that embodies a gradient movement. The colour and size of the gradient is defined by the user’s interaction with the website. The piece fits the entire window screen and depicts Rozendaal’s understanding of ‘aesthetics and play’. It is an abstract representation of time and space. Further, there are intricate calculations that allow the gradient to split and move across the screen. The simple set of rules creates an unlimited amount of gradient images that are generated by a click. 
                <br>
                The access to artwork through the internet allows it to reach millions of viewers that may not be possible if his work was exhibited in a gallery.
