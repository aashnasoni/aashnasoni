                "The bright colours and pulsating lights creates a sense of disillusion and confusion. Every time I click, a new gradient and pattern shows up which makes the experience more fun. is a fun interactive piece that as it states, encapsulates unique interactions, ones that could only be possible at the time the user presses ‘click’."

            <h2>
                It's interesting to see how the internet can be used to share artwork through the Javascript and create a unique experience for each person from their own computer screen. One can really lose track of time while clicking and viewing the various types of gradients that fill up the space. While it may look like a simple piece of art, 
                there seems to be quite a bit of abstraction and free-flowing thought that is reflected through the piece. There is a sense of rules and systems within an organic space and it's quite fascinating.
