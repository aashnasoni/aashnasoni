    style = "font-size: 15px;font-family: 'DIN Alternate';text-align: center;" >The texts share multiple perspectives about the influence of technology in our lives and how the internet and web influences human behaviour and tendencies. While using science to store and understand knowledge is necessary, humans may not be using these tools and methods in the correct manner today. Science must be stored in a manner that allows individuals to learn and access it, rather than destroying its efforts. This makes me think about how the internet is growing with the expansion and accessiblity of technology, but also ruining human privacy and human network rights. Big companies such as Google and Facebook exploit the use of science and use private information for their own success and profits, therefore becoming a threat through targeted advertising.</p>

The web has become a platform for free speech and understanding due to the ease of people being able to create applications without a cost. In today's day, it has become a universal language of communication regardless of the hardware being used to access it.   </p>
